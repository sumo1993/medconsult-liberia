```
I am a Liberian physician with over 15 years of experience

the Tubman National Institute of Medical Arts in 2003 and 
obtained my Bachelor of Science degree from the Mother Patern 
College of Health Sciences.

My career has been dedicated to improving healthcare access 
in Liberia through clinical practice, research, and community 
health initiatives. I have worked extensively with NGOs and 
government projects, providing me with unique insights into 
the healthcare challenges facing our communities.

I have established and managed multiple clinics throughout 
Liberia, combining medical expertise with practical knowledge 
of healthcare delivery in our specific context. During the 
civil war and Ebola crisis, I served in various capacities 
including training health workers and managing displaced 
persons camps.

My approach to medicine emphasizes preventive care, patient 
education, and building strong community health systems. I 
believe in treating the whole person and addressing the social 
determinants of health.
